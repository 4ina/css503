<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

We analyze and make explicit the model properties needed for such regularities to emerge in word vectors. The result is a new global log-bilinear regression model that combines the advantages of the two major model families in the literature: global matrix factorization and local context window methods. Our model efficiently leverages statistical information by training only on the nonzero elements in a word-word co-occurrence matrix, rather than on the entire sparse matrix or on individual context windows in a large corpus. The model produces a vector space with meaningful sub- structure, as evidenced by its performance of 75% on a recent word analogy task.


### Built With
This section should list any libraries that you built your project using.
* Used libraries: nltk(Natural Language Toolkit) 
* Keras(deep learning API)
* Numpy
* Pandas

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to use the software and install them.

Navigate to the location of the pip folder.
* NLTK(Enter command to install NLTK ) 
```sh
pip3 install nltk
```
Installation should be done successfully.
* For install pandas and numpy:
```
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
```

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

We had several problems, solved them with below links
* [Dataset initialization errors](https://stackabuse.com/text-classification-with-python-and-scikit-learn/)
* Split text to sentences  with "punkt,into a list of sentences
* [read csv file with utf8](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59866359/unicodedecodeerror-charmap-codec-cant-decode-byte-0x98-in-position-668-char)
